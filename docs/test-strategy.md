### 4.2 Testing Types

#### Functional Testing
- **Black Box Testing**: Test application without knowledge of internal structure
- **White Box Testing**: Test internal logic and code paths
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Test edge cases and limits
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Group similar inputs for efficient testing

#### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Page load times, response times

- **Production Environment**: Live application

### 5.2 Browser Support
- **Primary**: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Safari (latest)
- **Secondary**: Edge (latest), Chrome (latest-1)
- **Mobile**: Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile

### 5.3 Test Data Management
- **Test Data Creation**: Automated test data generation
- **Data Isolation**: Separate test data for each test run
- **Data Cleanup**: Automated cleanup after test execution
- **Data Security**: No production data in test environments

## 6. Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Loss**: User data corruption or loss
- **Security Breach**: Unauthorized access to user information
- **Browser Compatibility**: Application failure on supported browsers

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Issues**: Slow page load times
